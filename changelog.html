        </li>
        <li>
            Cleaning up logging a bit on the internal side of things; more things will use your logger instead of
            STDERR.  Provided more exceptions for things.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding function to stringify JSON objects; these must be a JSObject (generally from JavaScript code) or they
            will just be undefined.
